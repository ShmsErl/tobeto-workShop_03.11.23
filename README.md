# Spring Workshop
*****************

## The aim of this study :
The purpose of this study is to create User, Product, Category objects using Java Programming language and then using these classes to generate different objects from these classes. These generated objects are added to the list we created to simulate the database.
These operations are insertion, deletion, listing and update operations respectively. In the Controller layer, which is the communication layer of the application, appropriate APIs were written and operations were performed via 'postman'.
Since the APIs created provide communication in Json format, Postman was used as the appropriate tool.
